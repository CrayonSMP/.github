# 🎨 CrayonSMP — Custom Content Rules

*Last updated: October 2025*

At **CrayonSMP**, we believe creativity is the heart of our community.
Players are encouraged to design, develop, and share their own content — from models and textures to mechanics and custom features.
To ensure that all creations remain safe, fair, and consistent with the spirit of Minecraft, every submission must comply with the following rules.

## 1. Ownership & Permissions

* All submitted content must be **original work** created by you.
* If you use assets made by others, you must have **explicit written permission** from the original creator to use and share them.
* Third-party content must include **proper credit** and comply with its original license terms.
* Submitting stolen or unlicensed content will result in removal and potential restrictions from participation.

## 2. Rights of Use

* By submitting custom content to CrayonSMP, you grant CrayonSMP a **non-exclusive, royalty-free license** to:

  * Use, modify, and distribute your content within the project.
  * Include it in the **server resource pack**.
  * Display it on **official media**, such as the website, screenshots, or promotional materials.
* You **retain full ownership** of your content. This rule simply allows CrayonSMP to use it within the scope of the project.

## 3. Content Restrictions

* Submissions must **not** contain or depict:

  * NSFW or sexual material
  * Discriminatory, hateful, or politically extremist content
  * Copyrighted or illegal materials
* Any form of hate symbols (e.g., Nazi imagery) or harassment-related content is strictly prohibited.
* All submissions must be **appropriate for all ages** and comply with **youth protection laws**.
  
## 4. Gameplay Balance

* All items, blocks, and mechanics must be **survival-friendly and balanced**.
  Examples:

  * Items should not deal excessive damage or provide unfair advantages.
  * Strength, durability, and abilities should be proportional to how difficult the item is to obtain.
* Content intended solely for creative or showcase purposes should be clearly labeled as such.

## 5. Visual & Artistic Style

* Custom designs should **follow the official Minecraft Style Guide** to ensure visual consistency.
  Small creative deviations are acceptable, but the general blocky and pixel-based aesthetic must remain recognizable.
* Reference: [Minecraft Style Guide — Blockbench Wiki](https://www.blockbench.net/wiki/guides/minecraft-style-guide/)

## 6. Technical & Quality Standards

* All submissions must:

  * Function correctly without missing models, textures, or corrupted files.
  * Use **clear and unique file names** to avoid conflicts.
  * Keep texture sizes reasonable (preferably 16x or 32x).
* Content that causes crashes, lag, or compatibility issues may be rejected or removed.

## 7. Review & Enforcement

* All submissions are **subject to review** by the CrayonSMP staff team.
* The team reserves the right to:

  * Modify content to maintain consistency and performance.
  * Remove any submission that violates these rules or degrades server experience.
* Repeated or intentional violations may lead to temporary or permanent removal from the content submission program.

## 8. Final Notes

CrayonSMP is a place for creativity, collaboration, and respect.
By submitting content, you help shape a world built by the community, for the community — thank you for keeping it fun and inspiring for everyone. 💛
