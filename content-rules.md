# 🎨 CrayonSMP — Custom Content Rules

*Last updated: October 2025*

At **CrayonSMP**, we believe creativity is the heart of our community. Players are encouraged to design, develop, and share their own content — from models and textures to mechanics and custom features. To ensure that all creations remain safe, fair, and consistent with the spirit of Minecraft, every submission must comply with the following rules.

## 1. Ownership & Permissions

* All submitted content must be **original work** created by you.
* **AI-Generated Content:** Content created with the help of AI is permitted, provided it meets our quality and technical standards and does not violate third-party copyrights.
* If you use assets made by others, you must have **explicit written permission** from the original creator to use and share them.
* Third-party content must include **proper credit** and comply with its original license terms.
* Submitting stolen or unlicensed content will result in removal and potential restrictions from participation.

## 2. Rights of Use & Persistence

* By submitting custom content to CrayonSMP, you grant CrayonSMP a **non-exclusive, royalty-free, and irrevocable license** to:
* Use, modify, and distribute your content within the project.
* Include it in the **server resource pack**.
* Display it on **official media**, such as the website, screenshots, or promotional materials.


* **Withdrawal of Content:** To ensure server stability, this license remains valid even if you leave the project. Content cannot be retroactively removed if it is essential to the server's operation.
* You **retain full ownership** of your content. This rule simply allows CrayonSMP to use it within the scope of the project.

## 3. Content Restrictions

* Submissions must **not** contain or depict:
* NSFW or sexual material
* Discriminatory, hateful, or politically extremist content
* Copyrighted or illegal materials


* Any form of hate symbols (e.g., Nazi imagery) or harassment-related content is strictly prohibited.
* All submissions must be **appropriate for all ages** and comply with **youth protection laws**.

## 4. Gameplay Balance & Liability

* All content must be **survival-friendly and balanced**.
* Content should not provide unfair advantages; strength and abilities must be proportional to the difficulty of obtaining the content.
* **Liability Disclaimer:** CrayonSMP is not responsible for any technical issues, data loss, or client crashes caused by faulty community-submitted content.

## 5. Visual & Artistic Style

* Custom designs should **follow the official Minecraft Style Guide** to ensure visual consistency. Small creative deviations are acceptable, but the general blocky and pixel-based aesthetic must remain recognizable.
* Reference: [Minecraft Style Guide — Blockbench Wiki](https://www.blockbench.net/wiki/guides/minecraft-style-guide/)

## 6. Technical & Quality Standards

* All submissions must:
* Function correctly without missing models, textures, or corrupted files.
* Use **clear and unique file names** to avoid conflicts.
* Keep texture sizes reasonable (preferably 16x or 32x).


* Content that causes crashes, lag, or compatibility issues may be rejected or removed.

## 7. Review & Credits

* All submissions are **subject to review** by the CrayonSMP staff team.
* The team reserves the right to:
* Modify content to maintain consistency and performance.
* Remove any submission that violates these rules or degrades the server experience.


* **Credits:** CrayonSMP will make reasonable efforts to credit creators in official media, though name display for every specific instance of content in-game cannot be guaranteed.

## 8. Final Notes

CrayonSMP is a place for creativity, collaboration, and respect. By submitting content, you help shape a world built by the community, for the community — thank you for keeping it fun and inspiring for everyone. 💛
