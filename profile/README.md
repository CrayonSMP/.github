## 🙋‍♀️ About CrayonSMP

CrayonSMP is more than just another Minecraft Survival Multiplayer (SMP) – it's a **collaborative canvas** where the community holds the brush. Our server offers a dynamic and constantly evolving world where players can integrate their own creativity directly into the gameplay.

We provide the tools, you provide the imagination.

## ✨ How You Can Shape the World

Whether you want to design, build, or program, there is a place for every creative mind:

### 🎨 1. As a Content Creator (NexoMaker)

Become a game designer! With our partner application **NexoMaker**, you can easily design 3D models, textures, and custom behaviors for new items and blocks—all without complex coding.
* 📥 **Submit:** Your creations are reviewed and, once approved, are integrated directly into the CrayonSMP world.
* 🔗 **Start Here:** [NexoMaker Content Hub](https://nexomaker.com/)
* 🔑 **Requirement:** A GitHub account is required for content submission.

### 👩‍💻 2. As a Developer (Open-Source)

Are you passionate about Java and Minecraft development? We operate open-source and give you full creative freedom.

Every contributor receives their own dedicated GitHub repository to build and manage a unique **plugin** for the server. Help us build new features, squash bugs, and optimize the experience.

* 🛠️ **Technologies:** We leverage **CraftEngine**, **ModelEngine**, **MythicMobs**, and **GitHub Integration**, among others.
* ➡️ **Get Started:** Check out our [Development Guidelines and open Issues](https://github.com/CrayonSMP).

### 🎮 3. As a Player
